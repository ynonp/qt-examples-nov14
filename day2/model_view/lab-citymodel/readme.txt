Custom Table Model
==================

Context
-------

We received from another team data, which we need to integrate into a model.

The data is a list of cities, the 20 most populated cities in the world.
Each city has a name, country, flag, population and area.

The other team has provided us with a CityEngine, which has a simple interface to retrieve the data.  
We are not really interested how the engine is impletmented and the other team indicated the implementation might change at any time.

Your Task
--------
So please implement a CityTableModel, which list the cities in the rows. 

The columns shall contain:
    - city name
    - country + flag
    - population
    - area


As headers our UI designer asked to use the city engine header function for the columns. For the rows, they would like to have "City 1", ... "City 20".

We all hope you can archive this.


Hint
----

An earlier developer setup already a project (you are looking at) and provided a main function. The main function contains commented code, which sould be uncommented to text your model.


Good Luck!
